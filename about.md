I am an aspiring digital humanities/digital scholarship librarian -- I like playing with technology and digital methods, and I want to help other scholars do the same! I received my bachelor's degree in archaeology from Rice University and my MSI from the University of Michigan. Though I've now completed two digital humanities classes, I'm still not entirely sure if I have a solid definition for digital humanities. I'm just interested in thinking about the possibilities of new digital methods and new ideas of scholarship.

Some fun facts about me:

- I'm a Hufflepuff!
- I get really excited when I can solve a problem by writing a Python script
- I am from Texas and, though I don't really identify as a Texan, I use the world "y'all" obsessively
- I want to be on the Great British Bake Off when I grow up
