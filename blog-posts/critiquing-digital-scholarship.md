I am still new to the digital humanities field, but this class has taught me that it is necessary to critically look at digital humanities scholarship. Though it's easy to get swept away by "cool" looking visualizations or interesting new methods, we need to move past the "virtual high fives" as [Blevins](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/the-new-wave-of-review/) puts it and start taking a deeper look about how DH scholarship contributes to the humanities field outside of DH. **We need to think about what criteria are important for evaluating this new kind of scholarship, keeping in mind both the traditional values of good scholarship in humanities and the values that might prove necessary with new methods and media.**
<br>
So what are those criteria? As I mentioned earlier, our readings for this week, especially those from professional organizations, did not really outline criteria. However, some digital humanists have started to engage in this conversation about scholarly criticism and values. I'll talk about a few criteria that I and some other DH scholars think are important.
<br>
<br>
# Contribution to Field
<br>
Though digital humanities sometimes operates as though it is its own new field, the actual content of a lot of the scholarship has roots within their "traditional" fields. As Blevins discusses in his [blog post](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/the-new-wave-of-review/), digital humanities scholarship is often reviewed by digital humanities scholars. These scholars may be well equipped to critique digital humanities methods, but may not know enough about the subject matter to evaluate the soundness of the findings in the context of their field. I believe that DH scholars should try to engage both subject specialists and DH scholars in their review process, so that we can start looking at whether DH scholarship contributes to the humanities field as a whole rather than just digital humanities.

# Methodology
<br>
If digital humanists are going to start advocating for non-DH scholars to critique their work, they are going to have to provide some better explanations of their methodology. For many scholars, the complex and new methodologies are a deterrent from DH. Even if they may not completely understand the method, the fact that the methodology is explained goes a long way for establishing trust in the method (Gibbs). Scholars should help the reader understand what they did, why they did it, and how much the results can be trusted. The reader should be able to understand the process and potentially replicate it if they wanted to.

# Design and usability
<br>
I can't be in the School of Information and not talk about design and usability. To be completely honest, I struggle with the idea of including design and usability as criteria for critiquing DH scholarship. The question we keep throwing around in class is, "Do we really want design to be a requirement for tenure?" Yet I know that the way something is designed impacts how users interact with it and how accessible they find it. There's a lot of potential for enhancing arguments and presentation through design elements, and using design as a criteria would encourage DH scholars to continue experimenting with the possibilities and moving away from turning traditional means of publication digital. I'm still not sure to what extent we should be evaluating design in digital scholarship, but I still think it's important that it be a criteria.
<br>
<br>
# Sustainability
<br>
Another tough question for criticism is sustainability. Traditionally, scholars haven't had to worry much about whether their scholarship was sustainable because the institutions and habits for making it sustainable have been in place for a long time. Books and journals are pretty stable media because we know what to do with them, and once they are created, the media itself doesn't become "outdated." Yet [Presner](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/how-to-evaluate-digital-scholarship-by-todd-presner/) mentions sustainability as something to consider when critiquing scholarship. We as librarians are still coming up with methods and best practices for preservation and sustainability of digital scholarship. In my opinion, the biggest need for sustainability of data is for its potential for reuse, but not everything is and needs to be reusable. I think it might important for digital humanists to think about the sustainability of their scholarship as a minimum, but understand that sustainability might look different for each project and some projects may require more long-term sustainability than others.

# What needs to change?
<br>
So, with a few of these criteria in mind, what needs to change within the field to enact these criteria in reviews? I think digital humanists need to become more comfortable walking between digital humanities circles and their subject fields. Perhaps digital humanities scholarship should attempt to fit back in with reviewing of more "traditional" scholarship. Yes, there are some aspects of digital scholarship that may initially seem out of place, such as design and a need to detail methodology. **However, it seems to me that digital humanities has not done as good of a job engaging within subject fields as well as it has engaged with the public and within itself.** By outlining some of the criteria for criticizing digital humanities scholarship and opening up opportunities to engage with scholars outside of DH, I think we can move away from the "virtual high fives" and into deeper thinking about how digital scholarship fits within current scholarship.
