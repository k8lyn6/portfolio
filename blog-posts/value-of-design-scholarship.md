I, personally, have never been very good at design, or at least the "aesthetically pleasing" parts of design. However, one of the most valuable things I was reminded of in Lupton's book _Thinking with Type_ is that there are semantic codes and meanings embedded in design choices. The way in which information is presented and laid out on a page (either physically or digitally) affects how the reader interprets or finds the information. Words themselves have meaning, but so can the design of the information presented.

Even the most novice of designers understands this concept on a basic level, even if subconsciously. For instance, most people would never submit an essay written in Comic Sans because it is not an appropriate font for the kind of work they are submitting. Likewise, their essay probably contains paragraphs rather than one gigantic block of text, because paragraphs indicate structural information about the arguments presented and make the essay easier to read.

This is not the first time I have encountered the idea that design has meaning. In HTML, for instance, the different headers are used to show hierarchy within a page. You cannot use <h3> without first using <h2> and <h1>, and so forth. Each type of header indicates the level of subheading, which provides the reader with some organizational information. This information is also helpful from a usability standpoint, as screen readers use HTML tags for navigation.

These examples are more about the organizational design of information, but the same ideas are present in the more "aesthetic" part of design. The color, font, size, and overall "look" of the final document can determine whether or not a reader continues to read the document. I have been in situations where I have navigated to a website that had poor design, and I found it very frustrating to continue to read the information because the colors clashed or the font was hard to read. It can also determine how people react to the information. Companies spend a lot of time designing websites and other materials for publication to make them look memorable and inviting to read while still easy to navigate.

Although I see the value in design in general, I have a difficult time determining its place within scholarship because it seems that an academic does not have individual control over the design of their works through traditional publications. If an academic submits a paper to a traditional journal, it will be published with the journal's overall design ideas, which may or may not have been chosen deliberately. Other than basic structural design of a paper, the author probably has little control over how it will look once published.

As we move towards non-traditional means of publication, though, the academic has more control over the design of their work. Creating blogs or online portfolios provides the opportunity to use some of these design ideas purposefully to convey certain meanings, and scholars can (and should!) take advantage of that. The tools we learn about in this class may need to be incorporated into the textual part of an argument differently than with traditional publishing. Things such as the design of captions on screenshots of tutorials, or links to other helpful scholarship, can be designed in a way that enhances the experience for the user and conveys additional meaning to support an argument.

This means learning a little more about design to ensure that their information is presented in a way that is easy to follow and navigate and conveys the meaning they want to convey. I do not think it is necessary to become an expert designer, unless you find it particularly interesting. Design can be a helpful tool to present your work in an easier-to-navigate and more purposeful way.
