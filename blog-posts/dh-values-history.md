# Introduction
<br/>
In her article [_"This Is Why We Fight": Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities_](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/13), Lisa Spiro argues that the digital humanities community should adopt a set of values "to communicate its identity to itself and the general public, guide its priorities, and perhaps heal its divisions." She proposes five values as a starting point for discussion of these values. I am not an historian by training, but it seems that these five values could potentially be helpful to consider in the field of history.
<br/>
<br/>
# Openness
<br/>
Spiro makes the point that openness allows scholars to broaden the reach of their publications to gain a broader audience. It allows conversations to emerge between other scholars and between the author and the general public. Within the discipline, historians could benefit from greater openness so they can benefit from multiple perspectives about their research. Though their research may be from a historian's point of view, they could benefit from hearing from an archaeologist who is exploring a similar subject. Openness enlarges the reach of a scholar's work because it is not confined to a certain journal that may be behind a paywall.

# Collaboration
<br/>
Collaboration, like openness, allows a historian to spread the reach of her research and benefit from other perspectives. Although my understanding of research within an academic institution is limited to a librarian's perspective, it seems to me that more and more researchers are collaborating with people across disciplines. The field of history benefits from increased collaboration with other disciplines because it brings in additional methods and information. I believe the bigger issue is for tenure-track historians in institutions where less credit may be given for collaboration. Institutions should try to encourage collaboration and ensure that collaborative projects still count towards tenure.

Spiro additionally states that anyone who contributes to a project should be attributed. This is important in all disciplines involving research and intellectual property, and the field of history, like any other discipline, should apply this to both DH and non-DH publications.

# Collegiality and Connectedness
<br/>
The digital humanities community benefits from collegiality and connectedness because every person brings a different skill set to the community. Spiro brings up the example of THATCamp, an "unconference" where people can learn new skills from other people in the digital humanities community. People should be willing to help others learn tools with which they hope to work.

The field of history, however, has fairly established tools and methods, generally, so these principles do not immediately seem to apply. However, if there is an increase in collaboration and openness, historians might need to be willing to teaching others their research methods in order for others to fully participate and give feedback on their research. This could happen through informal presentations about research to other interested scholars or question and answer sessions.

# Diversity
<br/>
As an archivist and librarian, promoting diversity is an important part of my profession. Calls have been made within the profession for archivists to make conscious efforts to collect and promote collections created by and about people who may have previously been excluded for archives. I am not as familiar with the field of history, but I would assume that some historians choose to focus on writing the histories of people who have previously been excluded. Additionally, Spiro discusses that it is important for the discipline to "strive to include participants of diverse age, generation, skill, race, ethnicity, sexuality, ability, nationality, culture, discipline, areas of interest." Though most academic institutions are making more of an effort to recruit and accept diverse students and faculty, these efforts are not always evenly distributed across disciplines. History would benefit from increased diversity within the discipline because it brings more perspectives and different life experiences to the discipline.

# Experimentation
<br/>
Spiro states that "for the digital humanities community, experimentation suggests not only a method of testing ideas and creating knowledge but also its engagement in transforming traditional approaches to teaching and research." Even if an experiment fails, new knowledge is acquired through the process. The field of history already has established methods and routines within the discipline. However, these five values all try to push the boundaries of these methods and routines. History would benefit from being more open towards experimentation, such as through digital humanities projects.
