Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have encountered some professors and professionals who have strong online presences. Many of them advocated for young professionals to try out various ways of cultivating their own online presence, but I have not felt a strong desire to do so until recently. Since I hope to become a digital humanities/digital scholarship/digital projects librarian or archivist at a university library, I believe that creating some sort of online presence will be important. Some aspects and media appeal to me more than others, and I will discuss a few of my misgivings and excitement below.
<br/>
<br/>
# Flexibility of identities and personas
<br/>
I do not believe that any one of the readings this week specifically made this point, but I think that there is immense value in cultivating some kind of online presence because it puts a moderate amount of control of your presence in your own hands. Barbour and Marshall discuss a number of different identities and personas that an academic can construct online. Even if someone is hesitant about putting themselves online, there are different identities you can create for yourself that allow for different levels of sharing and interaction. For instance, Barbour and Marshall give a senior-level university manager as an example of of a manifestation of a "formal self" online. The formal self provides a way to build an online presence without moving outside of the professional realm or interacting much. Those who wish to involve themselves deeper can choose to interact with and share more with others. I believe there can be a lot of flexibility on how to build an online presence, and a person can ease their way into if they choose.

# Portfolios and blogs
<br/>
For me, portfolios and blogs are the most familiar and comfortable ways to create an online presence. Many people at the School of Information have online portfolios. An online portfolio for me is valuable because, as Sayers argues, it provides an alternate method of showing your work that is easily discoverable. Some of the work I have done is not easily explained or showcased in a resume or cover letter. However, an online portfolio allows me to add pictures, charts, graphs, or examples of work I have completed. I can document my experiences in a format that fits best.

Additionally, I have used blogs in a few of my courses, and I have found them to be mostly helpful when other students in the class are on board with the idea, too. I enjoyed the interaction and the ability to think about and express my ideas through somewhat casual writing and interactions. Tryon points out that blogging allows you to educate yourself in public, which can have positive and negative outcomes. There is a risk to publishing initial thoughts about something when you do not fully understand it, because others may react strongly or negatively. Tryon's point made me consider blogging as a professional in a new way. I think that blogs for professionals and academics are similar to reading responses or class blogs for students. Reading responses or blog posts help me to process what I have read and make connections to my own work or experiences. They do not represent my final or necessarily most coherent thoughts about a subject, but they do provide a jumping off point for further discussion. Blog posts can be helpful for students to facilitate learning, so it makes sense to me that academics and professionals could also use them in the same way.

# Twitter
<br/>
From what I can tell, many librarians like to use Twitter professionally. However, I have never felt entirely comfortable using Twitter, either personally or professionally. Iber makes some positive arguments for Twitter in his piece "A Defense of Academic Twitter." He argues that Twitter allows for academics to hold "global office hours" and interact with a number of different people. Twitter can facilitate interesting and lively conversations with people of different background and viewpoints, and it creates a network of people with similar interests.

I see that there can be value in interacting with others on Twitter as a professional. I have not felt particularly comfortable with Twitter, personally. I often feel awkward trying to start or jump into conversations on Twitter with people with whom I am not fully acquainted. I believe that Twitter can be a great tool for some academics and professionals who feel comfortable with it, but there are many other ways to engage with others online and cultivate an online presence. As a professional, I think I will choose ways other than Twitter.
