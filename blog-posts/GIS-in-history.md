# Reading reflection
<br/>
I believe that GIS can be a tremendous asset for certain humanities projects if it is used thoughtfully. Like a number of digital humanities tools, GIS can be a way to analyze and visualize a large dataset or body of work in a way that might not be possible for a person to do.

One of the challenges of using GIS is not actually with the tool, but with the dataset a researcher intends to use. Rarely can you find a dataset that is unproblematic and perfectly fits into the tool you wish to use. Using automated means of scraping geographic information from a corpus often results in messy or partially inaccurate data. For instance, I worked on a project where we used Named Entity Recognition to scrape the geographic locations from a dataset. While this worked well some of the time, the program was unable to recognize some outdated names and could not determine which Springfield a particular instance referred to. It also was only capable of picking up single words as geographic terms (so "Colorado River" was read as just "Colorado").

I think these challenges do not become problems as long as the researcher provides enough information to evaluate the project. For instance, a researcher should include a methods section in which she details , and more importantly, why she chose to do it that particular way. Even if there are problems with the methods, knowing what they are allows others to critique the project, provide feedback, and look at the results with their limitations in mind. Understanding the methods that the researcher used to create and analyze a GIS visualization allows us to evaluate the arguments better. Any visualization can be misleading without the context and methods, so I feel that it is important for those using GIS to clearly state their methods.

# Google Maps tutorial reflection
<br/>
Although I am fairly certain that I have done this tutorial before, I thought it was a valuable reintroduction to the possibilities of a simple tool such as Google Maps in visualizing data. Below is the test map I created through the tutorial.

I learned that one major drawback to using Google Maps with historical data is that it may not recognize historical place names. It is possible to change historical place names to modern place names before putting the dataset into Google, but it requires a pretty thorough understanding of what possible issues might come up. I do not think this would be a big issue for a historian or other humanist who does research in a specific subject and has a thorough understanding of the subject. However, as a librarian, I might want to use mapping tools such as Google Maps as a way to visualize information about a collection. I might have a basic understanding of the collection, but I do not believe it would be quite as in-depth as a historian's might be.

For instance, I am working on an NEH grant project with a professor with a collection of radio broadcasts and scripts about Africa's musical heritage. Through processing this material, I have gone through. I do not always have the subject expertise to know if a geographic term is a modern one or a historical one, but we have talked many times about how valuable something like a Google map would be to visualize some of the data from these programs. It would allow users to find programs based on referenced locations, and it might provide us with some valuable information about the distribution of programs that potential donors might find interesting. Though this would probably be a very basic map, I wonder if it would be worth doing if I knew that the messy data would result in a map that was fairly inaccurate.

One question I would like to explore is how historical data can be mapped when current country borders do not adequately represent the situation of the time period you wish to map. This is a big problem with the NEH grant project data, as many African countries have changed names and borders since the program began in the 1960s. Is there a way to visualize these changes more accurately to the time period of our data? What tools are out there that could allow us to better tag this information?
