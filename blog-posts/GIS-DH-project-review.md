# Animated Atlas of African History
<br/>
[The Animated Atlas of African History](http://www.brown.edu/Research/AAAH/index.htm) presents a number of different themes of African history from 1879-2002 in map form, such as territory names, changing boundaries, conflicts, and economic and demographic trends.

The map serves as a high level visualization of changes over time within the continent. It makes it easy to quickly see the rise and fall of parties in areas of Africa, where conflicts occurred, and the fluidity of borders over time. However, the map covers a very large span of time, and there is not a lot of additional information within the map to help me understand the purpose it might serve other than being a neat high-level visualization. The notes section of the project states that the map is a "general reference tool."

Their sources and notes sections extensively cite the data used for the maps. They used a number of maps and atlases to provide the geographic borders and areas. They additionally used primary and secondary sources to research the history of violence and political systems. The notes section goes into detail about their processes of research for some sections, but the sources page does not specifically state what data was used where.

The website overall is simple but easy to navigate and clear, which helps the user feel at ease when using the site and helps establish its credibility. The site itself is usable, but the map has a few kinks. I found it difficult to navigate at first. There was a help window that appeared when I first got to the page, but it disappeared and I could not find it again when I needed help. Some of the buttons on the map do not work.

# Texas Slavery Project
<br/>
Although I am familiar with this project from my last DH class, I thought it would be interesting to revisit the [Texas Slavery Project](http://www.texasslaveryproject.org/). The Texas Slavery Project contains a map on "the changing flows of enslaved and slaveholder populations in Texas over time."

The map shows the density of slaves and slaveholders per county over a span of eight years. Though some of this data could be just as effective in a graph (which they also provide), I think it is interesting to see it geographically because you can see how the population of slaves and slaveholders grew and spread over those eight years. It feels more firmly attached to place, and you can see the pockets of counties that started with relatively few slaves but had many by the last date in the map.

To create the map, they used a historical atlas to figure out the historical county boundaries. These boundaries were cross-referenced with tax assessments from each year, which is where the population data came from. They also include the database of population data used for the project; however, it is not in an inherently reusable form.

I will admit that the colors are slightly off-putting at first. However, it kind of sets the "mood" for the project, as it has a very southern, 19th century feel to it. I appreciate also that the University of Virginia is mentioned at the bottom of the page. For some reason, that association automatically gives a lot more credibility to the project.


The shading of the map along with the key is a little confusing. I understand what "shaded by total slaves" and "shaded by total slaveholders" means, but I don't understand the rest of them. I feel like the map could have been separated into multiple maps to make it clearer to the user what is depicted.

# Driving Through Time
<br/>
The [Driving Through Time](http://docsouth.unc.edu/blueridgeparkway/) project attempts to root primary sources within their location on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Rather than use maps as a way to research or analyze, this project appears to be pure visualization to give the user the experience of driving the Blue Ridge Parkway through time as a "digital tourist."

It is clear that the project tries to provide an experience through attaching pictures, stories, and information to geographic spaces. It is hard to say that this is necessary; the primary information is likely still effective standing alone. However, the feeling of "driving the Blue Ridge Parkway" would not be as easy to capture without the mapping.

I was not able to easily find the data used for this project. In the about section, they state that they tried to link the primary sources to a geographic coordinate "to the extent possible." They do not talk about how they assigned them or where that information came from. The data is not reusable.

I think the design of the site is pretty good. The image in the header of each page is beautiful and helps set the scene for the experience they hope to give the user. The interactive maps section could be designed better, as the text is hard to read and find what you are looking for. I additionally had a difficult time trying to find information on their methods and their data, which may not be as important for the casual user but would be important for peers to review the work.

From reading the introduction, I was actually prepared for a little more sophisticated maps. The introduction does a good job of trying to prepare the user for the experience they are trying to provide -- perhaps too good of a job. Once I actually got to the maps, though, I quickly became frustrated because they loaded slowly and were sometimes difficult to access. Parts of the website lead to archived pages from the Wayback Machine.
