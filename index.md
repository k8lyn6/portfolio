Hi y'all, and welcome to my site!

I am a soon-to-be graduate of the University of Michigan School of Information, where I specialized in preservation of information. I'm interested in the technical sides of preserving and providing access to information. I'm also interested in the new things we can do with that information through digital methods.

This is the home of my [HIST 698](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-methods/index.html) portfolio, where I have been exploring the digital humanities field through blog posts and small methodological projects. Like many digital humanities endeavors, this site is a work in progress.

I created this website using GitHub and Jekyll, and the theme is adapted from [folio](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) with some modifications. This is the third class where I've had to create some sort of website, but it's the first one I've been willing to include on my resume (so, thanks Fred for showing me an accessible way to build a site)!
