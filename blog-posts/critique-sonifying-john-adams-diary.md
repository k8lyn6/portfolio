During the past semester, our class has had many conversations about the definition of digital humanities and digital scholarship, and whether they should be seen as separate from traditional humanities or scholarship. One tentative conclusion we came up with is that digital humanities is about rethinking what scholarship is in an increasingly digital world.

My task for this week was to review a digital humanities project, keeping in mind some of the things we've discussed over the course of this class. Since one of the major takeaways I got out of this class was that one potential definition of digital humanities is about questioning what scholarship is, I decided to go a little bit out there in choosing a project to review.

I'll be taking a look at the project ["If I Could Read Your Mind - Sonifiying John Adams' Diary"](https://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/10/27/if-i-could-read-your-mind-sonifying-john-adams-diary/) from the Electric Archaeology blog. In the project, Shawn Graham takes data from topic models of John Adams' diaries and turns it musical using GarageBand. I will discuss the design and presentation of the project, the methods used, the accessibility of the data, and the contributions made to the field.

# Design
<br>
The overall design of the blog is simple, but pretty effective. It has a minimalist white background and a fairly easy-to-read font that's large enough to read. The margins are set well so that the text stays at the middle of the page in sizeable chunks. I had a moment of confusion when I first saw the page, because the header picture is a screen capture of the video. I expected to be able to play the video from the header, but it is just a picture.

Aside from the header picture, I appreciated the other visualizations and how they were interspersed throughout the blog post. The paragraphs of the post are mostly short and punchy, making it easy to read. Overall, although the design of the site is simple, I thought it was pretty effective and appropriate for a DH blog.

# Digital research methods
<br>
In terms of methodology, Graham gives a brief overview of the methods he used to create the music, but he could have talked more about what topic modeling is and why he used it. Though the blog's audience seems to be digital humanities scholars who probably already understand the basics of topic modeling, adding more information about topic modeling would help the novice digital humanist or casual reader better understand the process.

I think the best part of the methodology was Graham's description of choosing the sounds for each topic. Though the choices were somewhat arbitrary (brass instruments for governance because of Sousa), those choices seem to be what Graham is interested in exploring. The instrumentation is also vital for the listener to interpret the music.

# Accessible data
<br>
I was happy to see that the CSV that Graham used both for this project and for his book, as most DH projects I've run across don't share their data. The data is accessible for use as a CSV, since it can be opened in a multitude of readers. If I were to be nitpicky about the data, I would request that a little more information be included with the CSV file.

As a librarian, I'm interested in newly-emerging data repositories. One best practice for submission into data repositories is to include basic information about the data and how it was collected. Theoretically, Graham may have included this information as part of the book he links to in his post. Even though it's a pretty simple CSV file, adding a little more information might make it more accessible for reuse.

# Contribution to field
<br>
I've talked in other blog posts how digital humanities scholars should be connecting their work to their field better and outlining what they think their contributions. Graham states that he is interested in sonification because "the time dimension becomes a significant element in how the data is represented, and how the data is experienced." The elements of the music have the potential to convey information in different ways and could show insights one might not get from other forms of visualization.

However, this blog post stops short of the actual analysis. Graham presents the data via the composed piece of music, but does not analyze the music for new insights. This project contributes a methodological finding to digital humanities, but it does not move outside of methodology to the impact for the greater humanities field.

# Overall thoughts
<br>
I thought this project took a really interesting approach to sharing topic models. Of all the methods we've looked at in this class, topic modeling was the one that didn't quite sit well for me, because I still don't see the potential value of topic models. Sonifying topic models allows Graham and other scholars to think about and show the change over time of topics. This project definitely pushes the envelope on what scholarship is, but although unconventional, I see potential in this method.
