# I am a Digital Archivist
What's a digital archivist? Glad you asked. A digital archivist ensures the long-term preservation and access to today's digital materials. I have created policies and workflows for digital preservation from scratch at two different universities. The field of digital archiving is new and constantly evolving, and I have learned a lot about legacy storage media, file formats, and web archiving. To me, it is vital to preserve our materials today so that researchers in the future can access them.

# (I am a programmer)[https://github.com/k8lyn6]
Programming is my favorite kind of puzzling. I love to take a problem and figure out what pieces of code need to be put together to achieve the goal. I pursued programming and tech-focused classes during graduate school to supplement my education in archives and preservation, and have continued learning by myself since graduating. It satisfies my desire to continuously learn new things.

# [I enjoy playing with data](projects.md)
During college and graduate school, I dabbled in digital humanities where I could -- combining programming skills with asking critical historical questions. I tried to find data sets and problems where I could so I could continue learning how to analyze data.

# I am a runner
When I need to get away from my computer, I enjoy doing BodyPump and running. I have completed two half marathons, five 10Ks and 10 5Ks to date. Though I've been running for well over a decade, you'll still find me at the back of the pack during a race.
